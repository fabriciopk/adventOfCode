# Advent of Code solutions

To run and describe my solutions I'm using a simpler version of [Niccolas's](https://github.com/Janiczek/advent-of-code) Advent of Code runner/description.

## Usage
Use `make new-go year=2015 day=01` to create the folder structure needed to solve problems using golang. `make run-go year=2015 day=01` will compile and execute the proposed solution.
